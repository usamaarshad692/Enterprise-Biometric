# 🏢 Biometric Attendance & Identity Management System

High-scale biometric attendance and identity verification system built using C# (.NET Framework 4.8) with PHP-based image APIs and Microsoft SQL Server.  
Designed for institutional and large user environments requiring secure, reliable, and performance-optimized processing.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system handles biometric authentication and real-time attendance tracking in high-volume environments.

Core business logic and transaction workflows are implemented in C#, while PHP-based REST APIs manage biometric image capture and device-level communication.

The architecture focuses on scalability, security, data integrity, performance optimization, and maintainability.
